# AutoCare Admin

The Admin Side of the AutoCare app is solely focused on verifying auto-repair shops. Admins can view a list of pending shop applications, review submitted documents, and either approve or reject shops based on compliance with platform standards. The interface includes tools for document review and quick approval actions. By simplifying the adminâ€™s role just to shop verification, the system ensures that only legitimate and qualified businesses are listed, maintaining the integrity of the AutoCare platform.
